#Project 1: Bootstrap Portfolio

This is my first project for the course. It is a basic portfolio website to showcase projects and provide a way for potential customer to contact me.

User Story #1: Potential Client
    As a potential client I would like to see what kind of services offered and have a way to contact the developer.

User Story #2: Website Owner
    As a developer, I would need a way to advertise to clients, show a few of my projects and provide a way for potential clients to contact me

User Story #3: Recruiter 
    As a recruiter for a company needs to constantly be searching for talent, this is a great way to show your technical capabilities and get noticed by them.
