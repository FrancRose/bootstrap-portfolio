#Project 1: Bootstrap Portfolio

This is my first project for the course. It is a basic portfolio website to showcase projects and provide a way for potential customer to contact me. It is created with HTML and CSS, utilizing the bootstrap framework. I used boxicons instead of fontawesome for a bit of a change.

Navigating the site is easy and simple, with the navbar on top or links in the footer. Navbar(and site) is mobile responsive, being built with bootstrap classes instead of media queries.

User Story #1: Potential Client
    As a potential client I would like to see what kind of services offered and have a way to contact the developer.

User Story #2: Website Owner
    As a developer, I would need a way to advertise to clients, show a few of my projects and provide a way for potential clients to contact me

User Story #3: Recruiter 
    As a recruiter for a company needs to constantly be searching for talent, this is a great way to show your technical capabilities and get noticed by them.

#Ideas For Improvement
1. Dark Mode toggle, for those who prefer dark themes in their browser

2. Consider adding another framework/library to add increased interactivity or functionality to the site ie: animation or transitions, side scrolling instead of horizontal, header/footer transition animations.

3. Refactoring code and creating components to reduce file size and increase website performance.
